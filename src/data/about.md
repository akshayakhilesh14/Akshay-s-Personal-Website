# Intro

I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. I’ve published a research paper in the [International Journal of Novel Research and Development (IJNRD)](https://www.ijnrd.org/papers/IJNRD2310207.pdf) on the utility of the CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Deep Learning for autonomous vehicles. I have begun developing [GenerosityVend](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oj_K2XG1xdjsAGTROg0CL9DTrjMLSp0Q/view), a mobile app enabling users to generously provide snacks for blue-collar workers via vending machines. Moreover, I created the [Protean Rover](https://akshayakhilesh14.wixsite.com/the-protean-rover) Project, where I developed a multi-purpose autonomous rover capable of traversing various terrains and functioning as a mobile vending machine. 

Previously, I was an IT and Software Engineering Intern at [Al Habtoor Group](https://www.habtoor.com/en/) and [Dunecrest American School](https://www.dunecrest.ae), where I honed my skills in networking, backend systems, software engineering, and deployment challenges. At Al Habtoor Group, I produced ad-hoc visual reports for senior executives using IBM Cognos and learned tools like SQL, MySQL, and Microsoft Azure. At Dunecrest, I collaborated with the IT team to standardize deployment processes, ensuring seamless app installations across the institution.

In my spare time, I enjoy investing in people and ideas, focusing on innovative projects with high social impact. If you're looking for collaboration, mentorship, or support for a cause, feel free to reach out—I’m always eager to connect.

# Some History

- At the age of 5, I discovered my love for video games, diving into titles like FIFA 11, Need for Speed, and Minecraft. I spent weekends mastering [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_(video_game_series)) and [Efootball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFootball) and defeating my neighbors in [Rocket League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League).  
- When I was 10, I built my first model airplane. It wasn’t just about flying—it was about taking it apart and understanding how every piece worked. Around the same time, I got my first taste of coding with Scratch, creating a rudimentary soccer game that only I had the patience to play.  
- At 14, I joined the Robotics Club at school and built my first LEGO Mindstorms robot. It wasn’t particularly innovative, but it taught me the basics of engineering and collaboration. Around this time, I also fell in love with football (soccer), playing striker for my school team and staying up late to watch Champions League matches.  
- By 15, I was diving into programming, experimenting with Python and Java. I discovered Unity and developed a 3D maze game inspired by the ones I’d played as a kid. It wasn’t perfect, but it sparked my passion for game development.  
- At 16, I got my first internship at Al Habtoor Group, where I explored IT systems and learned about databases using IBM Cognos. I also configured Zebra handheld computers, which led to an obsession with understanding hardware systems. That same year, I published my first research paper on CIFAR-10 image classification using deep learning, combining my love for programming and problem-solving.  
- I was co-leading my school’s Academic Club, managing 900+ students. I also founded a 3D game development club, teaching Unity to peers and creating small but ambitious projects together. My weekends were spent juggling schoolwork, coding, and watching Premier League matches (while secretly managing my Fantasy Premier League team).  
- At 17, I started developing GenerosityVend, a mobile app that allows vending machine users to donate snacks to blue-collar workers. It was my first project with high social impact, and it cemented my belief in using technology for good.
- I joined the Protean Rover Project as the co-founder and CTO, helping design an autonomous rover that could traverse multiple terrains. We integrated mechanical systems with software, building a rover that doubled as a mobile vending machine. It was here that I learned to manage large teams and pay attention to minute details.  
- At 18, I started at UIUC, majoring in computer science. I explored cutting-edge technology, particularly in AI/ML and backend systems, while immersing myself in the campus community. My short-term goal is to master my CS electives, and my long-term dream is to contribute to groundbreaking software or quant projects, eventually pursuing a graduate degree.

Now, whether it’s coding a game, analyzing football stats, or exploring the latest in AI, I remain passionate about technology and its power to transform lives.
